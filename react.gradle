// This is the react.gradle file. It must be placed in the root directory (C:\SmartV3).
// Its purpose is to define core path variables that other build scripts (like Expo's) rely on,
// ensuring a smooth connection between the native (Android) and JavaScript (React Native) parts.

// 1. Resolve React Native Root Path
// This attempts to find 'react-native' within the node_modules folder.
ext.reactNativeRoot = file("node_modules/react-native")

// 2. Define CLI command (used by various tasks)
// This is crucial for cross-platform compatibility (Windows vs. Unix-like systems)
def isWindows() {
    return System.getProperty('os.name').toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT).contains('windows')
}
def cliPath = isWindows() ? "node.exe" : "./cli.sh"
ext.reactNativeCLI = new File(ext.reactNativeRoot, cliPath)

// Optional: You can add custom build tasks here if needed later, but this setup
// is sufficient to satisfy the 'apply from' requirement in settings.gradle.
